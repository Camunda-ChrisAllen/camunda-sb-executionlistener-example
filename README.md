# Camunda Spring Boot Example - ExecutionListener
Spring Boot Application using [Camunda](http://docs.camunda.org).

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-spring-boot-7.10.0](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#process-applications-maven-project-templates-archetypes).

## How does it work?

This example uses a ParseListener (specifically a ProcessApplicationEventParseListener) to parse BPMN start events.  A custom ExecutionListener is added to this parse listener so that when a process instance is instantiated, and the start event is fired, a process variable called "token" is added to each an every process.  This is global in scope, in that this will fire for all process definitions, not just one.

The files added to this project are:

- /src/main/java/org/camunda/examples
  - MyParseListenerPlugin.java
  - MyParseListener.java
  - MyExecutionListener.java
- /src/main/resources
  - process.bpmn
  - process2.bpmn

## How to use it?

### Running the application
You can also build and run the process application with Spring Boot.

#### Manually
1. Build the application using:
```bash
mvn clean package
```
2. Run the *.jar file from the `target` directory using:
```bash
java -jar target/Camunda Spring Boot Application.jar
```

For a faster 1-click (re-)deployment see the alternatives below.

#### Maven Spring Boot Plugin
1. Build and deploy the process application using:
```bash
mvn clean package spring-boot:run
```

#### Your Java IDE
1. Run the project as a Java application in your IDE using CamundaApplication as the main class.

### Run and Inspect with Tasklist and Cockpit
Once you deployed the application you can run it using
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).

Start Tasklist.  Start any available process instance one to many times.  Then go into Cockpit and check to see that those in-flight process instances have the "token" process variable set.

## Environment Restrictions
Built and tested against Camunda BPM version 7.10.0.
